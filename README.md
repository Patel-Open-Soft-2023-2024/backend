# NodeJs Backend for OpenSoft 23-24
Why a readme file for a private repository like this? We try to be as neat and close to the practices and techniques used in the software industry. According to <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Clean_Code.html?id=hjEFCAAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y">this</a> excellent guide :) 
## Introduction
The backend files here are made in JavaScript and use NodeJs (20.11 LTS).<br />Setup NodeJs in your machine through the steps given <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs">here</a>.<br />
New to MongoDB? Get started <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/">here</a>. <br />
Assuming you know about git and have it <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">setup</a> correctly!!

## Setting a Local Development Server

1. Assuming the git is set correctly and you have access to read this repository, clone this repo via the command:
```
git clone <repo http link>
```
2. Move to the root directory and run the command:
```
npm install
```
3. Type the command to run the server!
```
node server.js
```

## Contributing to the repository (correctly)
- Try avoiding committing in the main branch.
- Create a new branch by your name, sync the branch with the main branch (please), and then commit to your branch.
- Once your code has been approved by someone (not by yourself xD), we'll merge it with the main branch.
